        </header>
        <p>Kristiyan Panagiotis Giannis (Кристиян Панагьотис Гианис) is a serial internet fraudster and harasser currently living in Sliven, BG. In early 2022, Kristiyan Panagiotis Giannis began taking advantage of unsuspecting <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a> users and stealing their account information. Despite numerous requests for these actions to cease, and even at the threat of police involvement, Kristiyan Panagiotis Giannis continues to participate in this malicious behavior to this date of March 3rd, 2022.</p>
        <p>Kristiyan Panagiotis Giannis uses basic social engineering and phishing techniques to manipulate Discord users into giving him their account information. He specifically targets users who dedicate time and money towards game-oriented Discord bots so that he can sell their in-game items, fraudulently purchase Discord Nitro for himself and others, and otherwise commit financial fraud. Kristiyan Panagiotis Giannis specifically targets children, as they are the easiest to manipulate, and has blackmailed numerous children into giving him their parents' money and information.</p>
        <p>He seems to feel invincible and shielded while participating in such behavior, living in Buglaria. However, during my efforts in attempting to convince him to stop this malicious behavior, I've collected and documented several important pieces of information that have helped me identify Kristiyan Panagiotis Giannis. This website exists as a place that I can share public information about Kristiyan Panagiotis Giannis so that anyone else who is victimized by his gratuitous and fraudulent behavior can easily identify who he is and take their own personal actions to protect themselves against such behavior.</p>
        <p>If you are a friend, family member, or future employer of Kristiyan Panagiotis Giannis, I urge you to take this behavior into consideration.</p>
